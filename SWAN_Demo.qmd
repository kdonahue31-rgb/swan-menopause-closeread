# Welcome to the SWAN Study

Over 3,302 women participated in one of the most comprehensive studies of menopause ever conducted. This is their story.

## Meet the Women

The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation followed midlife women from 1996 to 2008, capturing their experiences through one of life's most significant transitions. @cr-map

:::{#cr-map}
<!-- Insert your Tableau US map visualization here -->
![Map of 7 SWAN study sites across the United States](path/to/map.png)
:::

These women came from [@cr-map]{pan-to="40%,50%" scale-by="1.5"} seven diverse communities across America.

Each site [@cr-map]{pan-to="60%,30%" scale-by="2"} represented different racial and ethnic backgrounds, from Detroit to Los Angeles.

[@cr-map]{scale-by="1"} Together, they paint a picture of menopause that reflects the true diversity of American women.

## The Shared Experience

While every woman's journey is unique, some experiences are nearly universal. @cr-symptoms

:::{#cr-symptoms}
<!-- Insert your symptom prevalence bar chart -->
![Top symptoms across all women](path/to/symptoms-chart.png)
:::

[@cr-symptoms]{highlight="1-3"} Hot flashes affect 67% of all women in the study.

[@cr-symptoms]{highlight="4-6"} Sleep disturbances and mood changes follow close behind.

But here's where the story gets interesting... [@cr-symptoms]{scale-by="0.8" style="opacity: 0.4"}

## Not All Journeys Are the Same

Our analysis revealed something surprising: [@cr-clusters]{} women don't experience menopause on a single path.

:::

Using machine learning, we identified [@cr-clusters]{pan-to="25%,50%" scale-by="2"} four distinct patterns of menopause experiences.

### Cluster 1: Low Baseline (41% of women)

[@cr-profile1]{} The largest group started with the healthiest baseline symptoms.

:::{#cr-profile1}
<!-- Insert Cluster 1 profile card with radar chart -->
![Low Baseline Cluster Profile](baseline_clusters_preliminary.png)

**Key Characteristics:**
- Median FSH: 4.5
- Lowest depression scores  
- 49.1% Japanese women
- Lowest bone density (0.925)
:::

[@cr-profile1]{zoom-to="bone-density"} But they had the lowest bone density and experienced the largest increase in hot flashes over 10 years.

### Cluster 2: Early Shift (34% of women)

[@cr-profile2]{} This group entered menopause transition earlier than others.

:::{#cr-profile2}
<!-- Insert Cluster 2 profile card -->
![Early Shift Cluster Profile](path/to/cluster2-card.png)

**Key Characteristics:**
- Highest baseline FSH: 33.5
- Early transition markers
- Mid-range bone density
- Moderate symptoms
:::

[@cr-profile2]{highlight="fsh-level"} Their hormone levels told the story—FSH levels nearly 7x higher at baseline.

### Cluster 3: Higher BMI (22% of women)

[@cr-profile3]{} Higher BMI doesn't always mean worse health outcomes.

:::{#cr-profile3}
<!-- Insert Cluster 3 profile card -->
![Higher BMI Cluster Profile](path/to/cluster3-card.png)

**Key Characteristics:**
- Average BMI: 38
- Highest blood pressure (132 mmHg)
- **Best** bone density (1.079)
- Fewer reported symptoms
:::

[@cr-profile3]{pan-to="50%,30%"} This cluster had the highest bone density and fewer symptoms despite elevated BMI.

[@cr-profile3]{highlight="race-stat"} Notably, 54.5% were Black women—double their representation in the overall sample.

### Cluster 4: Sleep-Disrupted (3% of women)

[@cr-profile4]{} A small but severely affected group.

:::{#cr-profile4}
<!-- Insert Cluster 4 profile card -->
![Sleep-Disrupted Cluster Profile](path/to/cluster4-card.png)

**Key Characteristics:**
- 100% reported sleep problems
- Highest depression scores
- Largest BMI increase over time
- Multiple compounding symptoms
:::

[@cr-profile4]{scale-by="1.5"} Every single woman in this cluster struggled with sleep—a reminder that for some, menopause is truly debilitating.

## How Their Bodies Change

These clusters didn't just differ at baseline—[@cr-trajectories]{} they followed different paths over 10 years.

:::{#cr-trajectories}
<!-- Insert your 4-panel trajectory charts (FSH, Depression, BMI, Hot Flashes) -->
![Symptom trajectories across visits 0, 5, and 10](path/to/trajectories.png)
:::

### Hormones Tell a Story

[@cr-trajectories]{pan-to="20%,20%" scale-by="2"} FSH levels rose dramatically for the Early Shift cluster—from 33.5 to nearly 120.

[@cr-trajectories]{pan-to="20%,20%"} All groups converged around 117 mIU/mL by Visit 10, a shared biological endpoint.

### Depression Diverges

[@cr-trajectories]{pan-to="70%,20%" scale-by="2"} While most groups saw decreasing depression, the Sleep-Disrupted cluster's mental health worsened.

### Hot Flashes Intensify

[@cr-trajectories]{pan-to="70%,70%" scale-by="2"} The Low Baseline cluster—who started with almost no hot flashes—saw the steepest increase.

[@cr-trajectories]{scale-by="1"} By Visit 10, they caught up to other groups. Menopause eventually affects everyone.

## Why It Matters: Race and Health Disparities

These patterns aren't random. [@cr-disparities]{} Race and ethnicity shape the menopause experience.

:::{#cr-disparities}
<!-- Insert your symptom prevalence by race chart -->
![Symptom prevalence varies dramatically by race](path/to/race-disparities.png)
:::

[@cr-disparities]{highlight="black-women"} Black women report hot flashes at twice the rate of Japanese women (80% vs 35%).

[@cr-disparities]{highlight="cluster-composition"} The Higher BMI cluster is 55% Black women—a stark reminder that health disparities have deep roots.

[@cr-disparities]{pan-to="50%,50%" scale-by="1.3"} These differences aren't just biological—they reflect systemic inequities in healthcare access, stress, and social determinants of health.

## The Takeaway

There is no "normal" menopause. [@cr-final-grid]{}

:::{#cr-final-grid}
<!-- Re-insert the 100-women grid -->
![Four distinct menopause patterns](path/to/cluster-grid-final.png)
:::

[@cr-final-grid]{pan-to="50%,50%" scale-by="1.5"} These 3,302 women taught us that menopause is as diverse as the women who experience it.

Some journeys are smooth. Others are turbulent. Many fall somewhere in between.

But every woman deserves care that recognizes her unique path—[@cr-final-grid]{scale-by="1" style="opacity: 1"} not a one-size-fits-all approach.
